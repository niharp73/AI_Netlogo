WHAT IS IT?
In a room of 23 people, what are the chances that some two of them will have the same birthday?

Make your best guess, then run the model and see how often it happens.

HOW IT WORKS
Each turtle is randomly assigned a birthday. If a turtle has the same birthday as another turtle in the room, it turns green.

The model doesn't take leap years into account (there are no February 29th birthdays).

HOW TO USE IT
Press SETUP to initialize the model.

Press GO ONCE to generate a single room full of people.

Press GO to repeatedly generate many rooms full of people. The SUCCESS RATE monitor will show what percentage of those rooms had at least one matching birthday.

THINGS TO NOTICE
Is the success rate higher or lower than you expected?

THINGS TO TRY
To try a room with more people in it, edit the view and increase max-pycor.

How many people need to be in the room before the chance of a matching birthday is at least 90%? (Is this higher or lower than you expected?)

Can you work out mathematically what the odds should be? (Hint: start by considering the odds when the number of people is small.)

EXTENDING THE MODEL
Include leap year birthdays in the list of possibilities.
